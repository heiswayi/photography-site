This repo contains Jekyll source code for [my minimalist photography site](https://heiswayi.github.io/photography-site). The photos displayed on the site are selective work only. The source of photos is automatically fetched from my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/heiswayi_nrird/) account.

Similar implementation has been used at [**https://heiswayi.nrird.com/photos**](https://heiswayi.nrird.com/photos).
